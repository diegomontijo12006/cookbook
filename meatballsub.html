        Step 2

      <p>

      <h2>Step 3</h2>
      <p>
        Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).

      <h2>Step 4</h2>
      <p>
        While the meatballs are cooking, cut baguette in half lengthwise and open like a book. Remove and discard some
        of the bread from the inside to make a well for the meatballs.

      <h2>Step 5</h2>
      <p>
        Brush baguette with olive oil and season with garlic powder and salt. Place baguette on a baking tray, open and
        with the oiled sides facing up.


      </p>

      <h2>Step 6</h2>
      <p>
        When the meatballs have 5 minutes left, slip the baguette into the oven and cook until lightly toasted.

      <h2>Step 8</h2>
      <p>
        Remove meatballs from the oven. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the hot sauce; mix gently to coat with
        sauce.

    <section>
      <h2>Step 9</h2>
      <p>
        Spoon meatballs and sauce into one side of the baguette, nestling meatballs in the well. Top with slices of
        provolone cheese.

      <h2>Step 10</h2>

        Return to the oven until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
